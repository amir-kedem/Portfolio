# Overview

This repository showcases a curated selection of data science, machine learning and deep-learning projects undertaken by me, designed to demonstrate hands-on experience in end-to-end workflows, algorithm development, implementation, evaluation and documentation. As I pursue my next professional challenge, this portfolio serves to illustrate my technical depth, analytical mindset and ability to collaborate across disciplines.

# What’s included

The repository is organised into the following folders, each containing Jupyter notebooks, supporting scripts and documentation that highlight key workflows:

1. Machine Learning

This folder presents classic supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Highlights include:

Data imputation and exploratory analysis using Pandas/NumPy to prepare real-world datasets

Feature engineering to extract meaningful signals

Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, clustering techniques)

Hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation and performance benchmarking

Clear notebook narratives that explain problem framing, methodology, results and insights

2. Image Processing

Here you will find computer-vision and image-analysis projects. Key features:

Use of OpenCV and image-specific preprocessing (e.g., resizing, filtering, segmentation)

Implementation of feature-extractors or classic vision algorithms

Visualisation of image-based pipelines and results

Discussion of challenges such as imbalance, noise, annotation or interpretability

3. Deep Learning

This section covers neural-network-based models and advanced architectures. It includes:

Design of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification or detection tasks

Utilisation PyTorch to build, train and validate deep models

Transfer-learning, model fine-tuning and evaluation on unseen data

Recording of metrics, training/validation curves and brief discussion of results, over-fitting and generalisability

4. Java

Recognising the importance of software engineering and cross-language fluency, this folder includes Java code samples:

Demonstrations of object-oriented programming, design patterns and algorithmic thinking

Small scale applications bridging data-centric logic and production-level coding practices


Each notebook is documented so you can follow the problem definition, data input, processing steps, modelling or algorithmic logic, result interpretation, and next-steps reflections.
