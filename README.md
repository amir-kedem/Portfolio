Role Intent: Product Manager / Data Science Collaborator

🧭 Overview

This repository showcases a curated selection of data science, machine learning and deep-learning projects undertaken by me, designed to demonstrate hands-on experience in end-to-end workflows, algorithm development, implementation, evaluation and documentation. As I pursue my next professional challenge, this portfolio serves to illustrate my technical depth, analytical mindset and ability to collaborate across disciplines.

🚀 What’s included

The repository is organised into the following folders, each containing Jupyter notebooks, supporting scripts and documentation that highlight key workflows:

1. Machine Learning

This folder presents classic supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Highlights include:

Data-wrangling and exploratory analysis using Pandas/NumPy to prepare real-world datasets

Feature engineering to extract meaningful signals

Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, clustering techniques)

Hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation and performance benchmarking

Clear notebook narratives that explain problem framing, methodology, results and insights

2. Image Processing

Here you will find computer-vision and image-analysis projects. Key features:

Use of OpenCV and image-specific preprocessing (e.g., resizing, filtering, segmentation)

Implementation of feature-extractors or classic vision algorithms

Visualisation of image-based pipelines and results

Discussion of challenges such as imbalance, noise, annotation or interpretability

3. Deep Learning

This section covers neural-network-based models and advanced architectures. It includes:

Design of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification or detection tasks

Utilisation of frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch (or analogous) to build, train and validate deep models

Transfer-learning, model fine-tuning and evaluation on unseen data

Recording of metrics, training/validation curves and brief discussion of results, over-fitting and generalisability

4. Java

Recognising the importance of software engineering and cross-language fluency, this folder includes Java code samples:

Demonstrations of object-oriented programming, design patterns and algorithmic thinking

Small scale applications bridging data-centric logic and production-level coding practices

Each notebook is documented so you can follow the problem definition, data input, processing steps, modelling or algorithmic logic, result interpretation, and next-steps reflections.

📝 Why this portfolio is relevant

Demonstrates the full stack of data science tasks: data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory analysis, modelling, and interpretation

Emphasises reproducibility and clarity: notebooks contain narrative explanations, inline comments and visualisations

Highlights adaptability: from classical machine-learning to deep neural networks and from Python notebooks to Java implementations

Aligns with cross-functional strengths: as a Product Manager with a technical bent, it shows that I can partner with UX/UI engineers, data scientists and stakeholders to deliver analytical value end-to-end

✅ How to explore

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/amir-kedem/Portfolio.git


Choose a folder of interest (e.g., Deep Learning/)

Open the main notebook (e.g., model_image_classification.ipynb) in Jupyter or VS Code

Review the narrative, code cells, visualisations and conclusions

Look at the accompanying scripts or resource files for production-oriented logic

🔍 Next steps

Going forward, I intend to expand this portfolio by:

Adding more real-world datasets (incl. industry-specific use-cases)

Incorporating deployment examples (e.g., API endpoints, containerisation)

Writing blog-style summaries to accompany each project for broader accessibility

Thank you for reviewing my portfolio. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your team’s data-driven initiatives.
